# AI Projects
 Projects on wide variety of material involving AI/Machine Learning

A* Search
    - Utilized A* search algorithim to determine states and solve the 8-tile puzzle
    - Deepend understanding of state space generation and implemented an efficient search algorithm

Facial Anaylsis
    - Used principal component anaylsis to make a blurry face clearer and make key physical features clear

Convolutional Neural Network
    - Implemented and trained a convolution neural network similar to the LeNet-5 model
    - Did extensive testing to create best model that achieved high accuracy on recognizing hand written numbers

Linear Regression
    - Trained a linear regression model to measure the ice on a lake
    - Interpreted model and used it to predict the number of ice days for the winter of the following year

Neural Network
    - Implemented and trained a neural network using pytorch
    - Evaluated model and experimented with model configuration to achieve high accuracy
    - Used the model to sort through images of clothing and did so successfully with high accuracy

Reinforcement Learning
